# omp-web - Development Notes

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev   # port 30178
```

Typecheck: `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`  
Lint: `npm run lint`  
**Never run `next build` during dev** — pollutes `.next/` and breaks `npm run dev`.

The dev server needs the `omp` binary installed (on `PATH`, or set `OMP_WEB_OMP_BIN`).
All live-agent features go through it; session browsing works without it.

Release development uses Node.js 26. GitHub Releases in `vantran-se/ompweb` are
the only user distribution channel; `@vantran-se/ompweb` is metadata and is not
published to npm. Bun may optionally launch a release build, but Node remains
the runtime. Preserve the checksum-verified, atomic installer/updater and its
rollback path. Do not migrate to Vite: replacing Next App Router routes,
proxy/auth, and the server would be an application rewrite.

## Architecture

omp-web never imports `@oh-my-pi/*` or `@earendil-works/*` packages (they are
Bun-only and cannot run inside Node/Next). See `DESIGN.md` for the full porting
contract.

```

**Session browsing** (read-only): pure-Node parsing of omp session `.jsonl`
files via `lib/session-reader.ts` — no child process involved.  
**Sending a message**: `startRpcSession()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts` spawns
`omp --mode rpc-ui` (one process per active session) through
`lib/omp/rpc-process.ts`.

Shared foundations in `lib/omp/`:

- `paths.ts` — Node port of omp's directory resolution (`~/.omp/agent`,
  XDG, session dir slugs).
- `omp-cli.ts` — locate/probe the installed `omp` binary (`resolveOmpBin`,
  `getOmpVersion`).
- `rpc-process.ts` — process + NDJSON protocol layer (`RpcProcess`).

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### RPC session lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One wrapper per session id, keyed in a `globalThis` registry.
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not.
- Idle sessions are disposed after a timeout; concurrent `startRpcSession()`
  calls must share a single start promise.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them
- **Fork** (Fork button on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** (Continue button / BranchNavigator): navigates the entry tree within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### ToolCall field normalization
Sessions store toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and streaming event handling.

### Live tool execution (`tool_execution_start/update/end`)
omp announces a tool the moment it starts, streams the tool's output while it
runs, and only commits the `toolResult` message at the end. The UI must not
wait for that commit:
- `useAgentSession` keeps a `liveToolResults` map keyed by `toolCallId`
  (seeded on `tool_execution_start` with `partial: true`, refreshed on
  `tool_execution_update` — omp sends the FULL accumulated partial result per
  chunk, latest wins — and released on `_end`/the committed toolResult).
  Committed results always win over live entries (`ChatWindow` merges them), so
  a reload never shows a stale snapshot.
- `ToolCallBlock` renders a `partial` result as **running** (spinner, and
  "Running tool…" instead of the "(no output)" marker when nothing has been
  printed yet), and opens the row while it runs when the "Keep tool calls
  collapsed" setting is off — that is what that setting means. `AppShell` must
  pass `toolCallsDefaultCollapsed` into `ChatWindow`; without it the setting is
  inert (the chat then always collapses).
- `tool_execution_update` is coalesced per tool call at display rate in
  `lib/message-update-coalescer.ts` (chatty commands emit ~10-100+ frames/s).
  `message_end` drops the pending `message_update` (the committed message
  supersedes it) but must NOT drop buffered tool updates.
- Live entries are cleared on `agent_start`, terminal `agent_end`, prompt
  send/settlement failure — a tool must never leak into the next run.

### Event protocol differences vs pi
omp emits no `prompt_done` / `prompt_error` / `queue_update` /
`compaction_start` / `compaction_end` events. Completion is `agent_end`
(`isTerminal !== false`), errors surface as failed RPC responses plus `notice`
events, and the queue length comes from `get_state.queuedMessageCount`.
New frame types (`turn_start/end`, `notice`, `todo_reminder`, ...) must be
handled or safely ignored.

### Running state SSE + reconciliation
- The sidebar listens to `/api/agent/running/events`, backed by `subscribeRunningSessions()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts`, so running badges update without polling.
- `useAgentSession` still treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events, but while a run is active it periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed `agent_end` events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.

### Composer-attached panels (`components/ComposerPanels.tsx`)
- The live todo plan (`TodoList`) and the subagent roster live **pinned above
  the chat input**, not inside the scrollable message list. `ComposerPanels`
  renders both, each independently collapsible via its header row (`chevron`);
  panels start collapsed (headers always show live progress / running-summary).
  Subagent chips carry live state (pulsing dot while `started`, check/alert/ban
  for terminal states) fed by the same `subagent_lifecycle`/`subagent_progress`
  SSE frames; clicking a chip opens the transcript dialog. `TodoList` keeps a
  non-collapsible default (`collapsible` prop) for SSR tests.

### Subagent integration (`lib/subagent-types.ts`, `lib/subagent-history.ts`)
- **Live detail**: `subagent_progress` frames carry the full `AgentProgress`
  object — `lib/subagent-types.ts` parses it defensively into
  `SubagentInfo.progress` (current tool/intent, tokens, cost, context
  gauge, resolved model, retry state, detached flag, agentSource). The
  composer chips surface the current activity + telemetry line; retry
  (`⟳ retrying N/M`) takes precedence over the tool line. `subagent_event`
  frames also feed a bounded per-subagent activity buffer shown in the
  transcript dialog.
- **Roster hydration**: `get_subagents` snapshots (which carry progress)
  rehydrate the roster after SSE reconnect (`refreshSubagentRoster`, wired
  into mount, send, and the reconcile poll). Terminal subagents vanish from
  the RPC registry — history fills that gap.
- **On-disk history** (`lib/subagent-history.ts`, `/api/sessions/[id]/subagents*`):
  omp persists each subagent's transcript to the parent session's sibling
  artifacts dir (`<session-dir>/<subagent-id>.jsonl`) and the parent file's
  task toolResults keep `progress[]`/`results[]` snapshots. omp-web recovers
  the roster from disk (`extractSubagentHistory`, result fields win over the
  mid-run snapshot), so past/finished runs show in the composer panel after a
  reload. The transcript route pages the sibling file byte-wise (mirroring
  `get_subagent_messages`, which is RPC-registry-gated and refuses files it
  doesn't know). The dialog reads only the final output — `<id>.md` via
  `?mode=completion` (bounded tail read that also works for transcripts
  beyond the 16MB paging cap) with a live `get_subagents` snapshot fallback
  for header enrichment; it never pages the raw transcript. Subagent ids are
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,80}` — the route validates before joining to confine reads
  to the sibling dir.
- **In-message task summary** (`components/MessageView.tsx` TaskResultPanel):
  the session reader allowlists a SIZE-BOUNDED subset of `task` toolResult
  details (telemetry only — no `output`/`stderr`, long text truncated to
  240 chars, `lib/session-reader.ts` `keepTaskToolResultDetails`), and
  expanded `task` tool calls render a per-subagent summary (status, agent,
  task, tokens/cost/duration/model, async marker) above the raw result text.
- **Chip extras**: agent-source labels (`user`/`project`), nested-subagent
  count (`inflightTaskDetails`/`extractedToolData.task` progress), and the
  `⤴` async marker (live `detached` flag or history `details.async`
  presence). Shared formatters live in `lib/subagent-format.ts`.

### Worktrees and project grouping
- `lib/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.

### Managed projects sidebar (`lib/project-registry.ts`, `/api/projects`)
- The sidebar lists **managed projects**: explicitly added directories (registered in
  `~/.omp/agent/projects.json`, written atomically as temp-file + rename) plus
  session-discovered ones — hidden entries excluded. Removing a project only
  marks it hidden (reversible via re-adding); hidden entries suppress session
  re-discovery.
- Registry paths are canonical `projectRoot`s: `POST` resolves worktrees to
  their main repo via `resolveProject`, and `resolveProject` returns the
  symlink-free on-disk form for plain directories so registered and
  session-discovered paths compare equal on Windows casing.
- `GET /api/projects` re-authorizes registered roots with `allowFileRoot()` —
  the in-memory browse allowlist does not survive restarts, and empty managed
  projects derive no root from sessions.
- The client sorts the merged list by most-recently-added (registration
  order), then by path for session-discovered projects
  (`lib/project-ordering.ts`); the order deliberately does NOT depend on
  session activity, so project rows never jump around while sessions refresh.
  Expanded project paths live
  in `localStorage` (`omp-web:expanded-projects`), defaulting to only the
  active/restored project expanded, and stale keys are pruned against the
  current project list (only after the first project fetch — an empty
  still-loading list must never wipe storage).
- Each project's session tree is capped at 5 roots with a show-more toggle;
  project rows are cards matching the session items' height/margins/accent
  treatment, and the active project's worktree selector renders directly
  below its row.

### File access allow-list
- `/api/files` is intentionally not a general filesystem browser. Allowed roots come from session cwds, their resolved project roots, `~/omp-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` call `allowFileRoot()` when they make a new location browsable.

### Session list caching — new sessions must appear immediately
- `listAllSessions()` (sidebar, command palette) is cached twice: a 30s TTL
  list cache in `lib/session-reader.ts` plus an mtime-keyed directory walk in
  `lib/omp/session-files.ts` (`listSessionFiles`).
- The walk cache keys on the **sessions root** mtime. On Windows/NTFS a new
  `.jsonl` inside an existing project subdirectory does NOT bump the root
  mtime, so the walk stays stale indefinitely.
- `invalidateSessionListCache()` (fired on `agent_end`, `session_info_update`,
  compaction, renames) must therefore ALSO clear the walk cache via
  `invalidateSessionFileListCache()` — never add a session-mutation path that
  forgets this. Regression test: `session-reader.test.mjs`.

### Chat scroll-follow
- `useAgentSession` follows the conversation: the effect depends on both
  `messages` (boundaries) and `streamState` (every token batch) and throttles
  to one `requestAnimationFrame` while a run is active (`followScrollFrameRef`).
- A manual scroll-up sets `completionScrollAllowedRef = false` and disables
  following until the next prompt; `scrollUserMsgToTop` handles the
  pending-scroll after sending.
- Programmatic smooth scrolling must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
  (`usePrefersReducedMotion` in `hooks/usePrefersReducedMotion.ts` — also the
  only way to stop SVG SMIL animations, which CSS cannot).

### MCP configuration (`lib/omp/mcp-config.ts`, `/api/mcp`, `components/McpConfig.tsx`)
- Project MCP config resolution order: `.omp/mcp.json`, `.omp/.mcp.json`,
  `mcp.json`, `.mcp.json` at the git top level (falls back to cwd for
  non-git dirs). Server definitions support `stdio`, `http`, and `sse`;
  exactly one of `command`/`url` is required and validated before any write.
- Writes are atomic (temp file + rename), preserve unrelated top-level keys
  (`disabledServers`, `$schema`, ...), and support rename via `previousName`.
- The MCP settings live in their own Settings tab (`SettingsTabs` id `"mcp"`,
  workspace-gated). Server list rows show a config-derived status dot
  (valid+enabled / disabled / invalid) — no live-connectivity probe exists in
  the RPC protocol, so failures surface as toasts (`toast.error`) from the
  editor actions, not inline text.
- The endpoint is guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.

### Plugins and skills
- `/api/plugins` shells out to the user's `omp plugin` CLI (`list/install/uninstall/enable/disable/upgrade`, `--json` where available) — never the Bun-only SDK.
- `/api/skills` uses `lib/skills-service.ts`, a pure-Node scanner mirroring omp's discovery order: project `.omp/skills` (walk-up), `~/.omp/agent/skills`, then the `.claude` / `.agent(s)` / `.codex` / `.github` compat dirs and managed skills.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent universal`, which installs into the ecosystem-standard `.agents/skills` dirs omp reads; project installs run with the selected cwd.

### Updates (`/api/omp-update`, `/api/app-update`)
- `GET /api/app-update` queries GitHub Releases for `vantran-se/ompweb` and
  preserves the client status shape while reporting the release installer path.
- The app update action downloads the versioned asset and `SHA256SUMS`, verifies
  and stages the release, drains managed sessions, activates it atomically, and
  restarts. Failed health recovery must restore and restart the previous release.
- `POST /api/omp-update` remains independent: it checks the installed OMP CLI
  and restarts active OMP sessions after an OMP update.
- `AppShell` and `SettingsConfig` distinguish GitHub application releases from
  OMP runtime updates.

### Auth and model config
- Auth flows go through RPC commands (`get_login_providers`, `login`) against the omp child process; credentials live in omp's `agent.db` (SQLite) which omp-web never touches directly.
- The Models panel reads and writes `models.yml` in the omp agent directory (`~/.omp/agent/models.yml`, `.yaml` fallback).
- API-key status endpoints must never return the raw key.

### Completion sound
- `hooks/useAudio.ts` stores the toggle in `localStorage` and reuses one `AudioContext`.
- Browser autoplay policy means sound must be unlocked from a user gesture; `ChatInput` calls the unlock hook from interactive controls, and `ChatWindow` plays the tone from `onAgentEnd`.

## omp Session File Format (v3)

Location: `~/.omp/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"type":"title","v":1,"title":"...","source":"...","updatedAt":"...","pad":"   ..."}   ← fixed 256-byte slot
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"provider":"...","modelId":"...","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...],...}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":N}
```

- Line 1 is a fixed-width 256-byte padded title slot, rewritable in place.
  Old pi files may lack it — the `{"type":"session"}` header is then line 1.
- Entries form a tree via `(id, parentId)`. Additional entry types
  (`title_change`, `session_init`, `mode_change`, `ttsr_injection`, ...) must
  be tolerated by readers.
- Large payloads (images) are externalized to the content-addressed blob store
  at `~/.omp/agent/blobs` and referenced from entries.

`entryIds[]` in `SessionContext` is a parallel array to `messages[]` — maps each displayed message back to its `.jsonl` entry id, used for fork and navigate_tree calls.

## Design Tokens & UI Kit (`app/globals.css`, `components/ui/`)

Warm-paper (light) / warm-ember (dark) palettes; every text/background pair is
WCAG AA-verified (measured ratios noted in `globals.css` comments). Components
must consume these variables — no hardcoded colors.

```
color:  --bg --bg-panel --bg-hover --bg-selected --border --bg-subtle
        --text --text-muted --text-dim
        --accent --accent-strong --accent-hover   (links / filled buttons / hover)
        --user-bg --tool-bg
type:   --font-serif (display headings, class .display-serif)  --font-mono
shape:  --radius-control (8) --radius-card (12) --radius-modal (16)
depth:  --shadow-card --shadow-pop --shadow-modal
motion: --dur-fast (150ms) --dur-med (220ms) --dur-slow (320ms) --ease-out-warm
```

`components/ui/` holds the shared primitives (built on `@base-ui/react`):
`primitives.tsx` (Dialog/Tooltip/Collapsible), `field.tsx` (form fields +
ConfirmDialog), `toast.tsx` (`toast.success/error/info`, mounted in AppShell).
Icons come from `lucide-react` — do not add new inline SVGs. The command
palette (`components/CommandPalette.tsx`, ⌘K/Ctrl+K) is built on `cmdk`.
