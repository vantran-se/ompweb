# Changelog

All notable changes to **omp-web** (`@vantran-se/ompweb`) are documented in this file.

---

## 0.6.0 - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- Move the canonical repository and package metadata identity to `vantran-se/ompweb` and `@vantran-se/ompweb`.
- Replace npm distribution with GitHub Release artifacts and checksum-verifying curl and PowerShell installers.
- Add versioned installations with an atomic `current` activation, retained previous release, and rollback-aware in-app updates sourced from GitHub Releases.
- Raise the runtime requirement to Node.js 26. Bun remains optional for launching release builds; Next.js remains the application and server framework.

### Security

- Validate release checksums and archive contents before extraction, use private same-filesystem staging, and fail closed on malformed release metadata or artifacts.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Add **Copy** and **Copy as Markdown** below user messages and completed assistant replies, with keyboard access and touch-sized controls. Copy only message text, excluding thinking, tool output, and renderer controls; preserve full source for oversized raw-text messages.
- Scope Ctrl+A / Cmd+A to the selected message, currently loaded chat, or active file contents instead of the whole page. Message selection includes collapsed extension previews and expanded details without toolbar labels. Newer pane focus takes precedence over retained child selections. Text fields and IME composition retain native behavior; browser-menu commands and embedded viewers remain browser-controlled.
- Add an off-by-default **Scope native Select All (experimental)** switch in Settings → Interface & Behavior. The per-browser preference narrows whole-page selections from native menus while leaving keyboard scoping independent. Disable it if browser selection handles or menus behave unexpectedly; intentional whole-page selections can also be narrowed.
- Play back a voice recording before transcribing or sending it. Pause keeps a left-side preview control; Stop opens a review deck with play, discard, and transcribe-and-send.
- Link GitHub issue and pull-request references in chat messages. Bare `#123` links to the session checkout's GitHub repository (the `gh` default remote, else `upstream`, `github`, then `origin`); `owner/repo#123` links to that repository. Code spans and existing links are left unchanged.
- Add a per-workspace **New Session** action to the sidebar so a fresh session can start directly in that workspace on desktop or mobile.
- Allow image attachments in queued follow-up and steering messages, with attachment counts in the queue panel and compact metadata restored after reload.

### Fixes & Improvements

- Refactor the shell, chat, composer, message rendering, Settings, session sidebar, and file panel into explicit controller and presentation boundaries; add shared responsive/geometry contracts, semantic UI primitives, a unified active-run rail, workspace-aware file tabs, and ownership-split global styles without changing OMP/RPC authority.
- Preserve queued Settings edits across failed native saves and retry the newest snapshot without reloading over local state; improve Settings Escape draft/IME safety, field and alert accessibility, toast expansion keyboard access, and workspace-aware MCP search results.
- Reduce mobile composer clutter by moving reasoning, fast mode, context, and dictation into More actions while keeping model and send controls immediately available.
- Refine workspace navigation with a narrower mobile drawer, quieter hover-revealed desktop row actions, clearer action grouping, and a less prominent global New Session control.
- Move the desktop new-session form toward the top of the available workspace to reduce unused space and improve scan flow.
- Avoid redundant new-session remounts and App Router fetches during workspace switching, and shorten mobile drawer motion to remove visible click lag and flashing.
- Give the mobile session title a dedicated centered region, keep More controls as a compact single-row icon bar without horizontal dragging, and render the theme picker through a viewport-clamped portal so every option remains visible.
- Improve phone and tablet ergonomics with safe-area-aware top chrome, a focus-trapped mobile workspace drawer, an actionable first-run workspace state, touch-sized sidebar actions, narrow-screen composer wrapping, clearer settings loading/retry states, and quieter streaming announcements.
- Keep primary actions usable at responsive boundaries: use compact icon-only Send, Queue, and Stop actions on phones, switch the file panel to its established overlay through 1100px, cap oversized persisted sidebars on narrower desktops, preserve full touch targets in the narrow composer and Settings search, and prevent live status text from forcing horizontal overflow.
- Align keyboard and streaming states across compact controls by preserving Tab order from the portaled theme menu, disabling reasoning changes during active runs, and keeping queued attachment actions visibly enabled.
- Keep long text inside its surfaces across live tool cards, Markdown links and inline code, file and directory rows, and narrow update/settings cards; give the live “Running tool” status the same padded inset as completed output.
- Make every Settings category phone-safe: stack shared setting cards and selects, keep provider actions labeled, wrap model thinking/retry controls, constrain Usage grids and tables, protect MCP names and project headers, and wrap update commands; redesign Agents as a full-width list-to-editor flow while preserving desktop layouts.
- Keep phone layouts at the native viewport scale when Compact, Comfortable, or Large interface scaling is selected, avoiding mobile WebKit root-zoom narrowing while retaining desktop interface scaling.
- Polish cross-surface consistency with one Settings content width, theme-aware accent foregrounds, full-size workspace and theme touch targets, and flex-safe sidebar errors while preserving the established shell and responsive hierarchy.
- Keep the Extensions & Tools settings panel scrollable on desktop and touch layouts, including long MCP server lists.
- Let non-native settings tabs render while the common OMP configuration loads, and show static MCP configuration before live status resolution.
- Give the new-session workspace picker a calmer destination card with a folder badge, stronger focus and hover states, a compact path context line, and touch-friendly spacing while retaining the native accessible select behavior.
- Defer the file panel and its Explorer/Git work until first use, use a fixed overlay for the file panel on tablet widths, increase mobile Explorer row height, enlarge Git touch targets, and keep compact session context available in the mobile overflow menu.
- Move focus into attached extension requests, contain keyboard focus in the custom extension terminal, and add a local retry action when a text file cannot be loaded.
- Add local retry actions and status semantics to Explorer, Git, and text-file failure states so transient workspace errors are recoverable without hunting for a toolbar refresh control.
- Defer Explorer and Git tab work until each tab is first opened, avoiding duplicate status requests and hidden-panel overhead while preserving visited tab state.
- Pause content fetches and file-watch connections for inactive file tabs, then resume them when the tab becomes active to reduce background network and rendering work.
- Defer the command-palette chunk until the first Ctrl/Cmd+K shortcut, reducing initial shell work while preserving the existing keyboard workflow.
- Add a visible command-palette action in the topbar overflow menu with the Ctrl/Cmd+K shortcut exposed to assistive technology, while keeping the palette chunk lazy.
- Replace the generic file-panel loading label with a shape-matched skeleton toolbar and rows, giving desktop and mobile users a stable visual handoff while the deferred panel chunk loads.
- Enlarge mobile file-search controls and add inline refresh actions to sidebar load failures, keeping the primary navigation recoverable without relying on the header icon.
- Keep the full-page Settings header clear of notches and home indicators, and enlarge its search, back, and close controls for touch devices.
- Add a localized **Return to latest message** control that appears when a long conversation is scrolled away from the bottom, with reduced-motion-aware scrolling and touch-sized mobile controls.
- Replace the sidebar’s generic loading label with shape-matched workspace/session skeleton rows for a calmer first paint on desktop and mobile.
- Clarify the mobile file-panel control by switching from a panel icon to an explicit close icon when the panel is open, while retaining the existing accessible toggle labels.
- Enlarge mobile session-search and composer attachment-remove controls so common mobile cleanup actions meet the same touch-target standard as navigation.
- Make the compact mobile topbar overflow horizontally navigable so the new command action, session context, and existing controls remain reachable instead of overlapping at narrow widths.
- Localize the command palette’s session-loading state instead of leaving English-only copy visible in Chinese and Japanese.
- Localize the workspace login title, password prompt, unlock action, and authentication errors for English, Chinese, and Japanese users.
- Localize composer attachment limits, skipped-file explanations, read failures, and running-agent attachment errors for English, Chinese, and Japanese users.
- Localize composer retry-abort and attachment removal labels so mobile cleanup and recovery actions match the active interface language.
- Close the mobile topbar overflow when launching the command palette from its visible trigger, preventing the menu from remaining open behind the modal.
- Add localized retry actions to image, audio, and document viewer failures so transient file-loading problems can recover without closing the file panel.
- Keep the login card clear of device safe areas, enlarge password and unlock controls for touch use, and retain the shared focus-ring treatment.
- Add localized inline retry recovery to workspace directory-picker failures, so mobile users can recover without closing the picker.
- Enlarge directory-picker profile, launch toggle, and extra-argument controls on touch devices for reliable workspace setup on phones.
- Enlarge mobile Settings navigation tabs and provider segmented controls to 44px targets, keeping the horizontal Settings header easy to traverse on phones.
- Localize the document viewer’s PDF type label so file metadata remains consistent with the selected interface language.
- Localize workspace-picker profile and extra-argument accessible labels for English, Chinese, and Japanese users.
- Enlarge archive-browser search and clear controls on touch devices for reliable session-history filtering on phones.
- Enlarge MCP refresh, server selection, add-server, config fields, and action buttons on touch devices for reliable mobile server setup.
- Localize MCP connection, enabled/disabled, off, and invalid status labels for English, Chinese, and Japanese users.
- Localize agent discovery error, warning, and fallback diagnostic messages for English, Chinese, and Japanese users.
- Announce agent discovery errors with alert semantics while keeping warning-only diagnostics polite, so assistive technology distinguishes failures from informational notices.
- Give the archive search clear action an explicit localized **Clear search** accessible label instead of reusing the dialog close label.
- Enlarge agent reload, unpack, create, search, list, copy, save, cancel, and remove controls on touch devices for reliable mobile agent management.
- Localize bundled, user, and project agent scope badges so agent metadata remains readable across supported languages.
- Announce MCP configuration load failures with alert semantics while retaining polite status announcements for live-status connectivity notices.
- Expand the Settings switch hit area to 44px while preserving the existing 40×24 visual track and focus behavior.
- Replace the text-file viewer’s generic loading label with shape-matched skeleton lines and semantic busy state for smoother first paint.
- Replace the conversation session-loading label with shape-matched skeleton lines and semantic busy state for a calmer chat first paint.
- Enlarge the conversation session retry action on touch devices so a failed session can be recovered reliably from mobile.
- Expose Explorer directory and search loading state through `aria-busy`, improving assistive-technology feedback while mobile file navigation remains touch-friendly.
- Replace the initial workspace-validation label with a shape-matched skeleton and semantic busy state for a calmer first paint.
- Show the Ctrl/Cmd+K shortcut in the command-palette toolbar trigger’s tooltip while retaining the existing accessible shortcut metadata.
- Give the archive search input an explicit localized accessible label instead of relying on placeholder text alone.
- Refresh the OMP version shown in new sessions after a CLI update without requiring an omp-web server restart. Reuse results while executable metadata is unchanged, with a five-minute fallback expiry for launchers. Keep the last known version visible between visits and distinguish initial loading from an unavailable runtime.
- Add `OMP_WEB_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE` to skip npm/OMP update checks and block in-app self-update actions, preserve the setting in service installers, and show the disabled state in Settings.
- Return browser host-tool and host-URI results as fire-and-forget frames while preserving OMP's original request ID, preventing `open_file` and clipboard bridge calls from hanging.
- Restore copy-success feedback after React Strict Mode re-runs effect setup.
- Keep sent-message copy, edit, and fork actions visible without hover or a reveal tap. Also keep file mention/download, Git open-file actions, and sidebar menus visible alongside their metadata; wrap message actions on narrow screens.
- Expand complete tool inputs inline, including multiline code and edit patches, while keeping command previews compact and output visibility unchanged.
- Keep composer controls on one line, with equally sized Send, Stop, and Queue buttons and model names truncating before short effort labels.
- Align the + button and primary action with matching composer insets.
- Clearly dim Attach files while the agent is running; queued messages remain text-only.
- Recover saved responses before reporting an empty agent reply after returning to a backgrounded page or PWA. Preserve provider errors and distinguish new runs from older answers.
- Catch up missed conversation entries incrementally after reconnecting or returning to the page, including during active runs. Restore quiet partial responses and live tool output without duplicating history or overwriting newer updates.
- Send prompts with image attachments in full again: commands reach OMP as one unchunked JSONL record. Protocol-v2 `rpc_chunk` framing is outbound-only, so any prompt over 1 MiB was rejected as `Unknown command: rpc_chunk` and reset the session after the prompt-ack timeout.
- Show the **New session** fork action below agent replies as well as user prompts, so the newest message in a conversation can fork the session. omp's `branch` command accepts a user entry only, so each reply forks at the prompt that started its turn; replies with no earlier prompt keep no fork action.

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-09-12

This release brings live tool-output streaming, a workspace picker for new sessions, voice dictation, new themes, an activity timeline with transcript export, and a redesigned settings experience.

### Highlights

- **Live tool output**: Tool calls now show a running indicator with streamed output while the tool executes, instead of a dead row awaiting the result.
- **Workspace picker for new sessions**: Choose the destination workspace directly above the new-session composer, with workspace names, exact paths, and worktree preservation.
- **Voice dictation**: Provider-agnostic speech-to-text dictation in the composer.
- **New themes**: OMP Midnight plus popular light and dark palettes with previews and CommandPalette support.
- **Activity timeline**: Activity group summaries, a minimap rail, and transcript export.
- **Composer upgrades**: Plus menu, context-ring gauge, context detail panel, and a `/loop` command to repeat a task up to N attempts.
- **Redesigned settings**: Full-page centered layout with a provider grid.
- **Long-session stability**: Targeted cache invalidation, oversized-file handling, better error surfacing, and render optimization.

### Fixes & Improvements

- Keep Cancel and Submit reachable in mobile extension questions by scrolling long questions and answers above a fixed action row and sizing the editor for short viewports.
- Confirm session deletion and workspace removal in dialogs on desktop and mobile. Cancel leaves data untouched; workspace removal keeps files and sessions.
- Center the workspace/session breadcrumb over the conversation column, and keep mobile generation speed and file-panel controls clear of the panel toggle. Explorer actions now have a separate touch-sized toolbar on mobile.
- Keep the top bar on one row with a fixed-width speed readout: compact units such as t/s, kt/s, and Mt/s, and a same-width ~ marker for average speed. The full rate remains in the tooltip; the whole pill hides when it cannot fit, without clipping or scrolling.
- Keep the fixed-width speed readout visible on narrow screens, including 320px: show theme, language, history, branches, and system controls directly when their measured widths fit beside any visible speed readout, and use a More disclosure otherwise, without shrinking touch targets. New-session screens do not reserve space for an absent readout.
- Open the language menu to the right of its left-side toolbar trigger so all options remain visible in the mobile More disclosure and the desktop header.
- Keep resized file panels and their contents inside the window at intermediate widths and non-default interface scales, wrapping file and Explorer actions when space is tight.
- Keep session action menus visible on touch devices beside fixed-width, right-aligned timestamps, with larger tap targets and titles using the remaining row width.
- Keep workspace header action menus visible on touch devices without first selecting or expanding the workspace.
- Keep provider and OMP System navigation in one horizontally scrollable row on narrow screens, and keep Save and Cancel in normal flow with inline save errors.
- Hide the Steer action when the only queued message is already a steer, matching the expanded queue while keeping Edit and Delete available.
- Keep the theme picker inside the mobile viewport by opening it to the right of its toolbar anchor.
- Match browser and installed-app chrome to the selected theme, with OMP Midnight as the launch fallback.
- Open the conversation sidebar on Back before leaving in narrow, overlay-sidebar layouts. On every layout, warn before Back, reload, or close can discard unsent text or attachments. Cancel keeps the current conversation and drafts; switching conversations still preserves drafts.
- Keep unsent-content confirmation active across consecutive Back presses on Android Chrome, including after switching to a new session.
- Some installed browsers cannot close a directly launched app programmatically. After confirming Leave, use native Back or Close if prompted. Chrome may bypass sidebar-first Back until the first interaction after launch, and Android process termination can bypass page warnings.
- Show app-close guidance only in standalone installed apps, never in ordinary browser tabs.

## [v0.3.6] - 2026-08-28

This release adds workspace renaming and reordering, improved context compaction views, prompt queue expansion, and clear network startup banners.

### Highlights

- **Workspace aliases and reordering**: Give your workspaces friendly names and drag-and-drop or use keyboard shortcuts to reorder them in the sidebar.
- **Inspect past context**: Browse full conversation history from before compaction occurred, with accurate before-and-after token counts and compaction method indicators.
- **Queued prompt expansion**: Expand and review queued follow-up prompts before they are sent to the agent.
- **Interactive questions in composer**: Respond to interactive questions from extensions directly inside the chat composer.
- **Accurate live stats**: Live generation speed (tokens per second) is now pulled directly from the agent runtime, and cache hit rates are displayed in both the top bar and session info panel.
- **Helpful network startup banner**: When starting omp-web, the terminal now displays clear, clickable local, LAN, and Tailscale network addresses.
- **Complete Chinese settings localization**: Fully translated Settings, Models, MCP, and Agent configuration screens with smooth hydration.

### Fixes & Improvements

- **Simplified model & reasoning pickers**: Redesigned selectors make choosing models and thinking levels quicker and easier on both desktop and mobile.

### Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed focus handling so closing the mobile sidebar never traps keyboard navigation.
- Added web app manifest and icons for installing omp-web directly to your device home screen.
- Server-side network requests now properly respect `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` settings.
